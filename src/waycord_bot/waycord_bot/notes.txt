commands should be split up across files
how?
    bot.py file loads in the bot object and exports
    all command files import it and make commands and export them
    main.py imports it. functions like an app.js

components:
    bot.py: loads the bot object and can be exported
    command files: have all the commands
    main.py: imports all commands and bot object
    encryption modules: encrypt all data. used by calls.py
    calls.py: sends all requests to the API. uses the encryption

bot needs to encrypt all data

bot makes api requests to the server/db

get archives by matching title:
    can return multiple archives if the title given matches multiple

delete archives:
    only deletes ONE message.


(bot) delete:
    get by title
    if list: error
    if not list(only 1): delete


(bot) add:
    if message id already exists, dont create. todo: since message.id is already unique, we prob dont needa worry
    title:
        search by title+creator.id
            if exists,
                error
                or title_1 is the new title
