bot needs to encrypt all data

bot makes api requests to the server/db

get archives by matching title:
    can return multiple archives if the title given matches multiple

delete archives:
    only deletes ONE message.


(bot) delete:
    get by title
    if list: error
    if not list(only 1): delete


(bot) add:
    if message id already exists, dont create. todo: since message.id is already unique, we prob dont needa worry
    title:
        search by title+creator.id
            if exists,
                error
                or title_1 is the new title
